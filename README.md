## **Challenge**:

Create a reusable button with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Don’t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

---

- User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text ✅
- User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
- User story: I can choose to disable the button ✅
- User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants) ✅
- User story: I can have different button sizes ✅
- User story: I can have different colors ✅
- User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
- User story: I can still access all button attributes ✅
- User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough
